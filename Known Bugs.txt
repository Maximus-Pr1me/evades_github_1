Known bugs:

- Sometimes Brute loses cooldown and can spam ability non-stop
- When Shade dies, Vengeance balls do not get despawned
- As Brute, cannot properly reverse shrinking.
- When Brute pushes balls, they get teleported instead of being pushed.
- When dying, spawns too close to the edge of map and gets teleported to a different map
